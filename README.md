- When a user launches the application, a get request is made to ##"https://labs.bible.org/api/?passage=random&type=json" to return a random verse for the day. a homepage is shown which has a scripture displayed for the day from a random selection

* On the same page, should be a button with the word "READ" that takes the user into the application

* When a user clicks on the read button, the user should be taken to a page where all the books of the bible in alphabetical order, sectioned according to testaments i.e Old and new testament are displayed

* When a user selects a book, the user should be able to see all the chapters of that particular book

* When a user selects a particular chapter, the user should be able to see all the verses of that chapter
